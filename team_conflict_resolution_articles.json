        "title": "The mediation role of work\u2013family conflict in the effect of workplace violence on job satisfaction and intention to leave: a study on health care workers in Turkey",
        "abstract": "Background This study aims to determine how workplace violence experienced by healthcare workers in Turkey affects their job satisfaction and intention to leave. It also examines the mediating role of employees\u2019 work-family conflict between these effects. Methods The PROCESS method was used in the study. The research was conducted on 595 health workers in three public hospital affiliated with the Istanbul Provincial Health Directorate. The convenience sampling method was used in the selection of the participants. Results As a result of the analysis, it was determined that there is a positive, significant, moderate (R\u2009=\u20090.35, p\u2009<\u20090.01) relationship between workplace violence and work-family conflict, and a negative, significant and weak relationship between workplace violence and job satisfaction (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.27, p\u2009<\u20090.01), there is a positive, significant, and weak (R\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009<\u20090.01) relationship between workplace violence and intention to leave. In addition, there is a negative, significant, and weak (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.27, p\u2009<\u20090.01) relationship between work-family conflict and job satisfaction, and a positive, significant, and weak (R\u2009=\u20090.28, p\u2009<\u20090.01) relationship between work-family conflict and intention to leave. Workplace violence had significant and negative effects on the employees\u2019 job satisfaction and significant and positive effects on the intention to leave and work-family conflicts. Discussion As a result of the mediating variable analysis, it was determined that work-family conflict has a partial mediator role in the relationship between workplace violence, job satisfaction, and intention to leave. The results are very important, especially for managers working in the healthcare sector. Reducing workplace violence against healthcare personnel will contribute to increasing productivity in the sector and providing better quality service to the healthcare sector.",

        "title": "Emotional intelligence, workplace conflict and job burn-out among critical care physicians: a mediation analysis with a cross-sectional study design in Egypt",
        "abstract": "Objectives This study aimed to examine the association between the effect of emotional intelligence on job burn-out and the mediating effect of workplace conflict management among critical care physicians. Design and setting A cross-sectional study design was deployed. Participants The studied sample comprised 144 critical care physicians working at two Egyptian tertiary care public hospitals. Measures The participants\u2019 responses to three questionnaires were studied, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire and the Conflict Management Formative Questionnaire, in addition to assessing coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) levels. Results Among the anaesthesiologists and critical care specialists examined, burn-out was reported by 63.9% of them. The findings of this study indicated that emotional intelligence played a notable role in predicting job burn-out, with a negative impact. Further analysis revealed that workplace conflict management acted as a mediator between emotional intelligence and the three components of job burn-out. Additionally, age and years of experience were found to have a negative correlation with burn-out and a positive correlation with conflict management. Furthermore, CoQ10 levels showed a negative correlation with burn-out, while displaying positive correlations with emotional intelligence and conflict management. Conclusion Conflict management acted as a mediator in reducing burn-out by demonstrating a significant negative relationship between emotional intelligence and burn-out. Initial findings indicated that possessing good emotional intelligence and conflict management skills had a positive influence on the immune system, as evidenced by higher CoQ10 levels. However, burn-out had the opposite effect, depleting the body\u2019s CoQ10 stores and negatively impacting immune-protective mechanisms. Therefore, it is crucial to implement emotional management educational programmes and update educational policies and pedagogical practices to enhance the emotional capabilities of healthcare providers, especially in demanding fields like critical care, to effectively address conflicts.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusion not available in metadata.",
        "summary": "The study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence, job burn-out, and workplace conflict management among critical care physicians. Results showed that emotional intelligence negatively predicted job burn-out, with workplace conflict management mediating this relationship. Age and experience correlated negatively with burn-out and positively with conflict management. Higher CoQ10 levels were associated with lower burn-out, and emotional intelligence and conflict management were correlated with higher CoQ10 levels. Conflict management was found to reduce burn-out by mediating the relationship between emotional intelligence and burn-out. The findings suggest the importance of enhancing emotional capabilities and conflict management skills among healthcare providers to mitigate burn-out effects and improve immune system function.",

        "title": "Mediation for Management: Dealing with Conflict in the Workplace",
        "abstract": "Dealing with conflict is an important part of the process of management; however few managers have received formal training in conflict analysis and resolution methods. Mediation, the process of a neutral third party helping parties in a dispute come to a mutually acceptable solution to a dispute is a non-coercive process that can increase job satisfaction, lower employee turnover, and improve the quality of decision making in an organization. Therefore the present paper argues in favor of integrating mediation as part of the core functions of management and as part of a systemic strategy to deal with conflict in the workplace.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusion not available in metadata.",
        "summary": "This paper emphasizes the significance of integrating mediation into management practices to effectively deal with conflicts in the workplace. It highlights that mediation, facilitated by a neutral third party, can lead to mutually acceptable solutions, enhancing job satisfaction, reducing turnover, and improving decision-making quality. The lack of formal training in conflict resolution for managers underscores the importance of incorporating mediation techniques as a core function of management to create a more harmonious work environment.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to find the mediation effect of interpersonal conflict between the relation of interpersonal communication and workplace deviance. The sample of the study was 233 doctors, selected from hospitals in tri-city (Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula). Interpersonal communication (IC), interpersonal conflict (IPC), and workplace deviance (WPD) variables were measured using standardized scale items. In the study, PLS-SEM was used to test the hypotheses. It was found that interpersonal conflict was specifically correlated adversely with interpersonal communication and favourably with workplace deviance. Further, the findings showed that interpersonal conflict significantly indirectly affected the relationship between interpersonal communication and workplace deviance. Finally, the implications and future scope of research were discussed.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of despotic leadership and workplace incivility on turnover intention among nurses in Punjab, Pakistan, by mediating the effect of work-family conflict. 573 questionnaires were distributed to nurses in Punjab, Pakistan's healthcare sector. SPSS was used to analyze the data, and Smart PLS was used to evaluate the model. The findings of the study reveal that despotic leadership and workplace incivility directly increase turnover intention. The independent variables were positively and negatively correlated with intent to leave the organization. The mediating effect of work-family conflict between despotic leadership and turnover intention was not supported. The study also examines how despotic leadership and workplace incivility affect work-family conflict, which has not been extensively studied. This research sheds light on employee turnover and stresses the importance of addressing negative workplace experiences to boost retention and well-being.",

        "title": "Sequential mediation analysis of workplace bullying, work-life conflict, and young employees\u2019 outcomes in Vietnam",
        "abstract": "There has been a growing focus on workplace bullying, especially in emerging countries. This study examines the impact of workplace bullying on young employees\u2019 outcomes in Vietnamese firms. Based on the conservation of resources theory, a sequential mediation model of five constructs (workplace bullying [WPB], work-life conflict [WLC], job satisfaction [JS], work support, and negative well-being [NWB]) was studied. Data from 238 young employees of different sectors was used to test the hypothesised model. The research data were analysed using AMOS version 22 to examine the constructed hypotheses. The results confirm that bullying is, directly and indirectly, related to employees\u2019 outcomes in terms of job satisfaction and NWB. Furthermore, the mediating effects of WLC on the relationships of bullying, job satisfaction, and NWB are confirmed. Contrary to previous research, work support did not mediate these relationships. In order to lessen the level of perceived NWB, it is essential to reduce negative acts at work as well as enhance the understanding of this phenomenon. This study contributes to the research literature on bullying in Vietnamese context, both theoretically and practically. From these findings, organisations might be beneficial from this study to reduce the level of workplace bullying. Further research could navigate which constructs could enhance young employees\u2019 positive experience at work in the face of workplace bullying.\u00a0",

Work-life conflict was confirmed to mediate these relationships, while work support did not. The study highlights the importance of addressing workplace bullying to improve employee outcomes in the Vietnamese context and offers insights for organizations to mitigate workplace bullying. Further research could investigate how to enhance young employees' positive experiences in the presence of workplace bullying.",

        "title": "Workplace Bullying and Supervisor Support Effects on Turnover Intention: The Work-family Conflict Mediation",
        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between workplace bullying, supervisor support, and turnover intention that is mediated by work-family conflict among banking employees in Indonesia. A quantitative method study with a total of 200 banking employees as respondents was conducted in Indonesia. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationship between workplace bullying, supervisor support, and turnover intention, with the mediation of work-family conflict. Workplace bullying increased work-family conflict and turnover intention among Indonesian banking employees. However, it was found that supervisor support does not influence the increase in work-family conflict and turnover intention. The research presented in this paper is mainly limited to databases that were searched due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the quantitative articles from the databases, there were few supporting works of literature accessible on workplace bullying in Asia because research on workplace bullying is uncommon. Using the findings of this research, practitioners may become aware of various behavioral and psychological aspects that may influence employee turnover intention and prevent them from occurring within the organization. This paper itself builds on the concept of Yoo and Lee (2018)\u2019s work because of its focus in Asia. The present results of this research also prove that the trust and relationship between supervisor and subordinate can help retain employees, especially those who experience personal problems. \nKeywords: Workplace bullying; Supervisor support; Work-family conflict; Turnover intention; Relationships",

        "title": "ADR and Workplace Conflict - A Podcast Analysis Nigeria, Britain and the US",
        "abstract": "The decline of union representation and the introduction of legal incentives for workers to resolve individual employment disputes without resorting to the courts has unequivocally made Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) increasingly prominent in the British industrial relations landscape. The conciliation service offered by the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) has been the most important sign and driver of this change. Although ADR has been encouraged in Western jurisdictions, particularly in the United Kingdom (UK) and in the United States (US), as a means to reduce time and litigation costs in relation to employment tribunal claims, the scarcity of scholarly publications, particularly on the benefits of utilising mediation or conciliation to settle workplace disputes is frankly unacceptable. On the other hand, Nigerian workers or employees are not encouraged or have little or no awareness of resolving workplace disputes or conflicts via ADR due to a lack of sensitisation in most organisations and a dearth of scholarly research on ADR to settle conflicts or workplace disputes in Nigeria, particularly with Mediation and Conciliation. This lack of awareness is a grave oversight compared to the UK. While British workers are encouraged to lodge their disputes with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Services (ACAS) before proceeding to an employment tribunal claim, Nigerian counterparts settle via the National Industrial Court (NIC) ADR, which is not always adequate. However, some sectors in Nigeria, like the Trade Unions, are quite complex, particularly disputes emanating from the Maritime Industry, which are hardly settled via ADR, unlike their UK counterparts. Hence, the jurisdictions mentioned above have different patterns and modus operandi for resolving workplace conflicts or disputes, and these will be meticulously examined in this paper. Additionally, the paper scrutinises the reason why the minister of labour and employment has so much power accorded or bequest to him to apprehend and refer a disputed award to the National Industrial Court (NIC) ADR. The paper employs a comparative and, for the first time, podcast analysis of workplace disputes in Nigeria and Britain, focusing on the different patterns of settling Workplace Conflicts such as discrimination, bullying and harassment. The paper concludes by unequivocally highlighting the benefits of mediation and its relevance to various entities involved in Workplace conflicts or disputes.
