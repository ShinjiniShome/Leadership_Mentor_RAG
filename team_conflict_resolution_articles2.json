        "title": "Conflict Management Strategies in Human Resources Management Work Teams",
        "abstract": "This research aims to investigate effective conflict management strategies in the context of human resource management (HR) work teams. Conflict in the workplace, especially in HR teams, can be a significant challenge that affects productivity and harmony among team members. This research uses a qualitative approach with descriptive methods. The research results show that the implementation of conflict management strategies in human resource management work teams has a significant positive impact in improving harmonious and productive working relationships in the workplace. By implementing an open communication approach, teams can easily share information, express opinions, and resolve conflicts more effectively. Collaborative conflict resolution also allows team members to work together to find a solution that is satisfactory for all parties involved, thereby reducing the possibility of larger conflicts arising in the future. Additionally, through developing communication skills, team members can improve their ability to listen, express thoughts clearly, and understand others' perspectives, all of which are important aspects of managing conflict wisely.",

        "summary": "This research explores effective conflict management strategies in human resource management (HR) teams. Qualitative methods were used to show that implementing these strategies has a positive impact on enhancing workplace relationships and productivity. Open communication and collaborative conflict resolution were found to be key in resolving conflicts effectively and preventing future issues. Developing communication skills in team members was also highlighted as crucial for managing conflicts wisely.",

        "title": "Teamwork Conflict Management Training and Conflict Resolution Practice via Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "This study implements a conflict management training approach guided by principles of transformative learning and conflict management practice simulated via an LLM. Transformative learning is more effective when learners are engaged mentally and behaviorally in learning experiences. Correspondingly, the conflict management training approach involved a three-step procedure consisting of a learning phase, a practice phase enabled by an LLM, and a reflection phase. Fifty-six students enrolled in a systems development course were exposed to the transformative learning approach to conflict management so they would be better prepared to address any potential conflicts within their teams as they approached a semester-long software development project. The study investigated the following: (1) How did the training and practice affect students\u2019 level of confidence in addressing conflict? (2) Which conflict management styles did students use in the simulated practice? (3) Which strategies did students employ when engaging with the simulated conflict? The findings indicate that: (1) 65% of the students significantly increased in confidence in managing conflict by demonstrating collaborative, compromising, and accommodative approaches; (2) 26% of the students slightly increased in confidence by implementing collaborative and accommodative approaches; and (3) 9% of the students did not increase in confidence, as they were already confident in applying collaborative approaches. The three most frequently used strategies for managing conflict were identifying the root cause of the problem, actively listening, and being specific and objective in explaining their concerns.",

        "summary": "This study implemented a transformative learning-based conflict management training approach using a virtual environment. The approach consisted of three phases, resulting in increased confidence among students in managing conflict using collaborative and accommodative approaches. The most common strategies employed by students in managing conflict were identifying root causes, active listening, and being specific and objective.",

        "title": "Optimizing the Construction Team Lifecycle: Exploring Influential Factors and Effective Strategies",
        "abstract": "This research study delves into the intricate dynamics of construction teams, aiming to optimize their lifecycle by comprehensively exploring influential factors and effective techniques. Drawing from in-depth interviews conducted with nine experienced construction team members, the research employed a content analysis approach to dissect and analyze the valuable insights obtained from these practitioners. The study has yielded seven key factors that are pivotal in effectively managing the construction team\u2019s lifecycle. These factors are identified as follows: communication, conflict management and dispute resolution, team environment and structure, goal setting and expectations, planning and task distribution, performance management, and coaching and skills enhancement. Each of these factors is critical in ensuring construction teams' seamless progression and success throughout their lifecycles. Furthermore, the research uncovered a range of techniques and strategies associated with each factor, providing a comprehensive toolkit for construction project managers and team leaders to optimize their team's performance and cohesion. By addressing these factors and implementing suggested techniques, construction professionals can enhance their ability to navigate the complexities of the construction team lifecycle, resulting in more efficient project delivery, improved collaboration, and, ultimately, tremendous project success. This study is a valuable resource for practitioners, researchers, and stakeholders in the construction industry seeking to enhance their understanding of construction team dynamics and improve project outcomes.",

        "title": "CONFLICT IN ORGANIZATIONS: ITS CONNECTION TO A HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT",
        "abstract": "In this day and age, conflict is a topic that is still being discussed. Conflict cannot be completely avoided in an organization, but it can be managed by minimizing it. The study employed a qualitative approach using systematic literature review methods to analyze and synthesize existing research on organizational conflict and its implications for healthy and productive work environments. Data collection involved reviewing 30 articles from reputable national and international journals, focusing on conflict management, leadership styles, and the impact of external factors on organizational dynamics. Effective conflict management by organizational leaders is essential in fostering a cooperative environment for handling conflicts within teams. Constructive conflict management can lead to positive changes and learning experiences for all parties involved in organizational conflicts. Effective conflict resolution strategies can stimulate innovative problem-solving among employees and prevent a decline in motivation and creativity due to high levels of conflict.",
