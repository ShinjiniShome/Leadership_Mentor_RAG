        "title": "The impact of digital fatigue on employee productivity and well-being: A scoping literature review",
        "abstract": "Digital fatigue, a condition arising from prolonged engagement with digital tools, significantly affects employee productivity and well-being. This scoping review explores the contributing factors, consequences, and mitigation strategies related to digital fatigue in professional settings. A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature (2010\u20132025) identified key themes, including cognitive overload, the impact of synchronous vs. asynchronous communication, and the blurring of work-life boundaries. Findings indicate that excessive digital engagement leads to mental exhaustion, reduced job performance, and heightened stress. Contradictions in the literature highlight the need for contextualized approaches to digital communication. Practical recommendations include hybrid communication strategies, digital wellness programs, and revised organizational policies to support employee well-being. Future research should employ longitudinal and experimental methods to assess the evolving nature of digital fatigue and its long-term impact on workplace dynamics. By integrating sustainable digital practices, organizations can mitigate digital fatigue and foster a healthier, more productive workforce.",

        "title": "A Comparison of Cognitive and Social Presence in Online Graduate Courses: Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Modalities",
        "abstract": "Over the last decade, online courses have continued to expand, and students in higher education are being offered increased access to technology and communication tools in online learning programs. This action research study analyzed the impact of two distinct types of online course instruction (100% asynchronous and weekly online synchronous meetings) on learning outcomes, including cognitive and social presence, knowledge gained, and student perceptions. Study participants consisted of graduate students enrolled in online sections of a course on program evaluation. Four sections of the course were available: two included a synchronous meeting using web-conferencing, and two used an asynchronous format. A quasi-experimental design was used and included a pre-post test knowledge assessment, a modified version of the Community of Inquiry questionnaire (CoI), and end-of-course student evaluations. The mean ratings of the CoI in this study ranged from 3.75\u20134.60 out of 5. There was a significant difference in the cognitive presence scores for synchronous (M=4.26, SD=.529 asynchronous (M=4.47, SD=.454) conditions; t(97)=-2.07, p =.041. Our results suggest when students learn in an asynchronous format, they have a higher cognitive presence. The average scores on the knowledge pre-test were the same for both sections but post-test scores were slightly higher in the asynchronous section. Instructor ratings were high for all courses. These findings may offer valuable implications to higher education programs that have recently transitioned to online teaching modalities.\u00a0",

        "summary": "This action research study examined the impact of 100% asynchronous and weekly synchronous online course instruction on learning outcomes among graduate students in a program evaluation course. Results showed higher cognitive presence in the asynchronous format, with slightly higher post-test scores compared to the synchronous format. Implications suggest benefits for online teaching modalities in higher education programs.",

        "title": "New era of medical education: asynchronous and synchronous online teaching during and after COVID-19",
        "abstract": "COVID-19 struck the world suddenly and unexpectedly. Since traditional education requires face-to-face communication, to avoid further spreading of the virus a majority part of that education has moved online. Our study attempts to compare the differences between online medical education with a unique course design and traditional face-to-face education. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a total of 4,098 medical students between 2019 and 2020, including two groups of students who received online education and classroom education for the same subjects, respectively. Freshmen enrolled in September 2018 received traditional classroom physiology and pharmacology education in the spring semester of 2019. Because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, freshmen who were enrolled in September 2019 received online physiology and pharmacology education in the spring semester of 2020. The final marks of the two groups of students were recorded and compared. Data on students participating in online discussions, learning, homework, and watching instructional videos were also recorded. There was no significant difference in the final academic performance between the two groups [average mark: 55.93 (online education) vs. 56.27 (classroom education), P = 0.488]. Further analysis showed that student participation rates in online discussions, online learning, and online viewing of instructional videos were closely correlated with final grades in online courses (P < 0.01). In conclusion, our results suggest that the pedagogical effects of online education during COVID-19 were promising, and we provide a well-designed medical online course to inspire further improvements in online education. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a massive temporary conversion of offline education to online education worldwide. Previous studies have noted that more students believed they had better learning experience in face-to-face learning. However, with our method of online teaching, we still showed a relatively similar performance result compared with offline education.",

        "summary": "The study compared online medical education with unique course design to traditional face-to-face education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of 4,098 medical students showed no significant difference in academic performance between online and classroom education groups. However, student participation in online discussions, learning activities, and instructional videos significantly impacted final grades in online courses. The findings suggest promising pedagogical effects of online education during COVID-19 and highlight the potential for further enhancements in online education methods.",
